# CSE_472_Machine_Learning
This repository contains the assignments of the course CSE 472 Machine Learning. The assignments are implemented in Python. The assignments are as follows:

## Assignment 1: Matrix Transformation and Eigen Decomposition
[See the details here](./Offline_1/matrix_transformations_and_eigen_decomposition.ipynb)

## Assignment 2: Logistic Regression and AdaBoost for Classification

[See the details here](./Offline_2/CSE472_%20Assignment%202.pdf)

Here we used 3 datasets for classification. The datasets are:
1. `Telco Customer Churn` Dataset
2. `Adult` Dataset
3. `Credit Card Fraud` Dataset

First, we preprocessed the datasets. Then we applied Logistic Regression and AdaBoost for classification. We compared the performance of the models using different metrics.

## Assignment 3: Feed Forward Neural Network from Scratch

[See the details here](./Offline_3/CSE%20472%20Jul%202023%20-%20Assignment%203.pdf)

Here we implemented a Feed Forward Neural Network from scratch. We used the `MNIST` dataset for training and testing the model. We used `ReLU` as the activation function and `Cross Entropy Loss` as the loss function. We used `Mini Batch Gradient Descent` for optimization.
